## Session Goals
- Convert game from level-based to endless runner (vertical progression)
- Add one-way platforms that boost player upward
- Implement procedural level generation
- Create start screen with character selection
- Add pause functionality

## Work Completed

**Endless Runner Conversion:**
- Changed game progression from horizontal to vertical (upward = forward)
- Camera now follows cat vertically as they fly higher
- Distance/height tracking replaces fixed level goals
- Cat resets to ground level on landing (not game over)

**One-Way Platform System:**
- Platforms converted to sensors for pass-through behavior
- Cat passes through platforms when moving upward
- Landing on platform from above triggers upward bounce
- Platform bounce gives strong upward velocity (-25)

**Procedural Generation:**
- Platforms randomly generate above the player (150-400px vertical spacing)
- Enemies randomly generate above the player (100-300px vertical spacing)
- Random horizontal positions across screen width
- Objects cleaned up when they fall 2 screens below the cat
- Infinite vertical scrolling with sky gradient (blue → dark → space)

**Start Screen / Menu:**
- New MenuScene with "CAT LAUNCHER - Pinball Edition" title
- Character selection with 3 cat options:
  - Fluffy (orange)
  - Bandit (purple)
  - Midnight (black)
- Visual cat previews with selection ring highlight
- Start button (disabled until cat selected, pulses when ready)
- Gameplay instructions displayed at bottom

**Character System:**
- Cat texture changed to white base for proper color tinting
- Selected color passed from MenuScene → GameScene → Cat entity
- Tint applied to cat sprite based on selection

**Pause System:**
- Pause button in top-right corner (circular with pause icon)
- Hover effect (yellow highlight)
- Pause overlay with:
  - "PAUSED" title
  - Resume button (green) - continues game
  - Main Menu button (orange) - returns to character select
- Game physics freezes while paused

**UI Updates:**
- Height display (center top) - shows max height reached
- KO counter (enemies defeated, not remaining)
- Game over screen shows: Height, Score, Enemies defeated

## Key Decisions
1. **Vertical progression** - More natural for slingshot launching upward
2. **One-way platforms** - Pass through from below, bounce from above for satisfying gameplay
3. **Procedural generation** - Endless replayability without manual level design
4. **White cat texture** - Allows proper color tinting for character selection
5. **UIScene pause** - Keeps pause UI independent of game scene pausing

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Game was progressing horizontally | Rewrote generation/camera to use Y-axis instead of X |
| Cat color not showing in game | Changed base cat texture from orange to white for tint |
| Platforms blocking from below | Made platforms sensors, manually detect landing direction |
| Need to track progress | Height calculated as ground level minus current Y position |

## Current State
- **Playable endless mode** running at http://localhost:3002/
- Start screen with 3 character choices
- Infinite vertical progression
- Procedural platform/enemy generation
- Pause menu with resume and main menu options
- Core loop: select cat → launch upward → bounce off platforms → hit enemies → see how high you can go
