## Session Goals
- Define art asset specifications for game pivot (endless scroller → pinball roguelike hybrid)
- Create documentation for onboarding contributors
- Set up GitHub repository

## Work Completed

**Game Direction Pivot:**
- Decided to shift from infinite scroller to pinball/roguelike hybrid
- Core concept: Pinball main mechanics + roguelike upgrade system between runs
- Tech stack remains unchanged (Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Matter.js)

**Asset Guide Created (`ASSET_GUIDE.md`):**
- Defined image formats (PNG-24 for sprites, JPG for backgrounds)
- Specified asset sizes for 720x1280 canvas:
  - Player cat: 128x128 px
  - Board background: 720x1280 px
  - Enemies: 64x64 px (small), 96x96 px (large)
  - Flipper: 120x40 px
  - Bumper: 64x64 px
  - UI icons: 48x48 px
  - Upgrade cards: 180x240 px
- Defined minimum test kit (6 assets to get started)
- Established file organization structure

**Conventions Doc Created (`CONVENTIONS.md`):**
- Documented tech stack rationale (why Phaser, TypeScript, Vite)
- Explained canvas dimensions choice (720x1280 for mobile-first)
- Detailed image format decisions (PNG vs JPG vs WebP vs SVG)
- Explained "Power of 2" textures (why it doesn't matter for WebGL/Phaser)
- Documented asset sizing reasoning
- Outlined code conventions and scene structure

**GitHub Repository Setup:**
- Created repo: https://github.com/Kellum/cat-game-pinBall
- Pushed initial codebase + new documentation
- 3 commits: Initial, Asset Guide, Conventions

**Checkpoint System Reorganized:**
- Created `checkpoints/` folder structure
- Split monolithic checkpoint.md into dated session files
- Added tags for searchability
- Created main index and tag reverse-index

## Key Decisions
1. **Pinball + Roguelike hybrid** - Combines satisfying physics gameplay with meta-progression
2. **PNG-24 for sprites** - Lossless with alpha, universal support
3. **128px player sprite** - 2x render size for crisp scaling on retina
4. **No power-of-2 constraint** - Modern WebGL handles NPOT textures fine
5. **Separate docs** - ASSET_GUIDE (quick reference) vs CONVENTIONS (deep explanations)
6. **Checkpoint folder system** - Smaller files, tags, easy navigation

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| No gh CLI installed | User created GitHub repo manually via web |
| No Homebrew available | Skipped CLI installation, used manual workflow |
| Asset size questions | Researched Phaser/WebGL capabilities, documented reasoning |
| Growing checkpoint file | Split into folder-based system with tags |

## Current State
- Repository live at https://github.com/Kellum/cat-game-pinBall
- Documentation ready for artists/contributors
- Awaiting art assets for pinball prototype

```

## Next Steps
1. Receive test art assets (6-piece minimum kit)
2. Implement pinball table layout (flippers, bumpers, rails)
3. Add flipper controls (touch/click zones)
4. Design roguelike upgrade system
5. Create upgrade selection UI between rounds
